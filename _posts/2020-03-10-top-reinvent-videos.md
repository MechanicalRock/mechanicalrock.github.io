# Introduction

I became a father for the first time recently. Turns out your hands are pretty much full for a lot of the time, rocking an upset infant back-and-forth in an attempt to get them to settle. Watching all the re:invent content I wasn't able to attend when I was at the conference seemed like a good way to fill in the time. I thought I'd put together an expansive list of my favourite videos from the last couple two re:invents. These sessions run a bit of a gamut; some are what I consider base-line knowledge, some are advanced use-cases, some are just interesting. Generally, they focus around the serverless ecosystem and topics that I think developers needs to know to become expert serverless practictioners.
