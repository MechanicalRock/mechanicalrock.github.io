## My story

My experience is like so many women in the tech industry. At university, I could count the number of women on my course on less than one hand. My first job in the tech industry I was on a team of twelve developers, and I was the only female.
When I joined Mechanical Rock there was about fifteen of us and again I was the only female. I thought this was normal. Over the years I have seen Mechanical Rock expand and hire some amazingly talented women. I can honestly say that it has made Mechanical Rock an amazing place to work, each person brings something new to the table.
