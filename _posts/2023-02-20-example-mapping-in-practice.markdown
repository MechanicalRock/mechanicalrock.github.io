In my many years as a Software Engineer, Scrum Master and Delivery Lead I've worked on projects of various shapes and sizes in varying industries and firmly believe that one of the most challenging things you face is building a common understanding of requirements between the customer and development team.

To me, Example Mapping is the closest you can get to perfection. This article sums up the principles of Example Mapping, compares the opposition, provides examples itself and shares tips and techniques for you to master it in your own teams.

# What is Example Mapping
Example Mapping is a technique using coloured cards to facilitate a session with the dev team (or at least one representative from) and Product Owner and SME(s) to elaborate a User Story and create a common understanding amongst the team.

Yellow cards represent the User Story, blue cards specify rules, green cards provide examples and red cards are for asking questions. 

**provide an example here**

The Product Owner brings a new User Story to the session, presents to the team with a brief explanation and then the facilitator sets to work . I like to run my sessions as follows:

1. Allow the Product Owner to describe the User Story including the how and why
2. Set a timer for five minutes quiet time and allow the team to raise questions ready for the Product Owner
3. During the quiet time the Product Owner may start creating Rules on the blue cards
4. Once quiet time is over I go through the question cards and get the team member who raised it to ask the Product Owner the question
5. As questions are answered, new rules are defined and then clarified using Examples as a whole team exercise
6. The board is continually refined as questions are answered, new rules  written and examples provided
7. To ensure that we have something solid to start on, I try to keep focus on one Rule at a time to ensure that sufficient examples are required and continually ask "Dev team, are you happy you can start building this" and "Product Owner, are you happy with this outcome"

At the end of the session the goal is to at least have a starting point for the User Story development and a plan to follow up any additional sessions requried.
