# Why CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is used to specify the layout, size, position of HTML elements on a webpage by dividing it into major regions. Unlike `flexbox` which is a one-dimensional layout system, either rows _or_ columns, CSS Grid allows you to specify your layout in both rows _and_ columns.

To properly understand the _need_ for something like CSS Grid I think its important to examine where we have come from in terms of web layouts. First we started using `<table>` for layout which became problematic as soon as we had build responsive web pages to support viewing on both mobile and desktop. Next came Bootstrap and, more importantly, the 12-column grid which is used in a majority of component libraries to this day.

A key feature of Bootstrap was being able to specify elements which would occupy a variable number of columns based on the screen size; something that just wasn't easily possible with `<table>`. However this has also led to some rather messy HTML and "`<div>` hell".

One of the real benefits of using CSS Grid is that it allows you produce much cleaner and more succinct HTML. Also by eliminating the 12-column grid we no longer force our content to conform to those columns making things such as a 5-column grid possible. One of the quotes that encapsulates CSS Grid in a great way is:

> CSS Grid allows you to make HTML into what is was supposed to be. Markup of content. Not visuals, which belong in the CSS.

# Setting Up CSS Grid

To get started using CSS Grid, you simply need to use the `display: grid;` property. From there you are free to define your columns and/or rows. For example:

```
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 5fr 1fr;
grid-template-rows: 1fr auto 1fr;
```

This will create a 3x3 grid; the 3 columns will be distributed such that the first takes up 1/7th of the available space, the next takes up 5/7ths and the last taking up another 1/7th. The first and third row will take up the same amount of space with the second row taking up as much space as it needs to fit the content.

It is also possible to mix units when defining your grid. For instance if we were to use the following columns:

```
grid-template-columns: 300px 3fr 1fr 20%;
```

The first column would always be 300px, the second column will be 3 times larger than the third and the final column will always be 20% of the overall grid width.

# Positioning Elements

There are two main CSS properties for positioning elements on the CSS Grid; the `grid-column` and `grid-row` for positioning based on column and row respectively. There is also a third called `grid-area` for specifying both column and row in a single property. You can specify positions for elements as follows:

```
grid-column: <start-column> / <end-column>;
grid-row: <start-row> / <end-row>;
grid-area: <start-row> / <start-column> / <end-row> / <end-column>;
```

Consider the following examples:

- `grid-column: 2 / 5;` - the element starts in column 2 and ends at column 5. The `end-column` is not inclusive so this element will only span 2 columns.
- `grid-row: 1 / 4;` - the element starts in row 1 and ends at row 4. Again, the `end-row` is not inclusive so this element will only span 2 rows.
- `grid-area: 2 / 3 / 2 / 5;` - the element starts in row 2, column 3 and ends in row 2, column 5.

One of the more useful utilities for positioning elements is the `span`. Instead of specifying an `end-column` or `end-row`, you can instead specify a number of columns or rows than an element spans. Modifying the above examples to instead use `span` produces:

- `grid-column: 2 / span 2;`
- `grid-row: 1 / span 2;`
- `grid-area: 2 / 3 / span 1 / span 2;`

Note that if an element doesn't have any `grid-column` or `grid-row` property specified, it will be positioned in the next available area starting from the top-left and will span a single row and column.

# Named Areas

When defining your CSS Grid, it is also possible to specify named areas for each of the rows and columns on the grid. This allows you to specify a `grid-area` property on your elements which includes the corresponding name.

If I define a grid with the following properties:

```
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 5fr 1fr;
grid-template-rows: 1fr auto 1fr;
grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "nav content ad"
    "footer footer footer";
```

I can then define an element with the property `grid-area: header;` and it will be placed at column 1, row 1 and will span 3 columns. Similarly, I can define an element with the property `grid-area: footer;` and know that it will be placed at column 1, row 3 and also span 3 columns.

# Aligning, Justifying and Placing

You can align, justify and place elements within the grid in exactly the same way as `flex`. Once you establish a `display: grid;`, you have access to the same `justify-content` and `align-items` properties used for Flexbox.
