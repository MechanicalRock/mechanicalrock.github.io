## What's The Problem

Welcome back to the 3rd instalment in the "Seeds of Inception" series, where we build upon [Part 2](https://mechanicalrock.github.io//aws/continuous/deployment/cdn/spa/cloudfront/2018/04/01/inception-pipelines-pt2) by setting our pipelines to 'defrost'. By this I mean solving the snowflake environment issue that plagues software development; where each environment is unique and special and just a little bit different from all the others in the DEV to PROD chain.

Getting down to the guts of it, I'll demonstrate one way to deploy your single `aws_infrastructure.yml` template across multiple AWS Accounts. All from the comfort of your very own [Inception Pipeline](https://github.com/MechanicalRock/InceptionPipeline/tree/post/part-3)

## What Technologies Are We Going To Use

* [Cloudâ€‹Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
* [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
* [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)

## What Are The Prerequisites

To get started, you will need the following:

* Having [Part 2](https://mechanicalrock.github.io//aws/continuous/deployment/cdn/spa/cloudfront/2018/04/01/inception-pipelines-pt2) installed.
* Having a second 'production' AWS Account, and enough permissions to create a pipeline.

## How It All Works

Since a picture is worth a thousand words (and I'm feeling too lazy to try writing up a long and boring blob of text) checkout the diagram below:

![cross account components]({{ site.url }}/img/inception-pipelines/part-3-x-account.png)

In essence, there are three IAM roles in play, and shared access to a non-production S3 bucket and KMS key:

1. The `CodePipelineRole` which is used to execute the CodePipeline pipeline.
2. The `CloudFormationAssumeRole` which is assumed by `CodePipelineRole` to execute the CloudFormation deployment action. Note that this is in the production account.
3. The `CloudFormationDeployerRole` which is assumed by `CloudFormationAssumeRole` to deploy the contents of `aws_infrastructure.yml`

To glue all the roles together, there is a cross-account-shared KMS key to allow encrypting and decrypting of the build artefacts.

Honesty time, I lost countless hours trying to get production to see non-production files as all I kept getting were `S3 403` errors. Turns out it wasn't the IAM permissions, just production needing to decrypt the non-production files. The lesson here kids is that the KMS key is important!

## Where Do I Get The Seed Files

All the files are in the Part 3 branch in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MechanicalRock/InceptionPipeline/tree/post/part-3). Inside you'll find a dedicated directory for your `non-production` and `production` accounts.

### What Are The Files

Rather than repeat what every file is, I'll just talk about the really interesting ones:

* Non-Production Account
  * **aws_seed.yml** - Contains the production Stage and CloudFormation deployment action. The production action is essentially the same as the non-production action, just with a different parameter json file and set of roles.
  * **aws_infrastructure_production.json** - This contains the production infrastructure values.
* Production Account
  * **aws_seed.yml** - Contains the two roles which get assumed from the non-production account to carry out the CloudFormation deployment.

## Taking It For A Spin

If you've been following along with these posts then it is a simple as diffing the files and copying across the relevant bits for `aws_seed.yml` and any of the other files you're missing.

If not (I'll try not to judge you too much), you should be able to open a command prompt, change directory into either the `non-production` or `production` folder and then just follow the steps from [Part 1](http://localhost:4000/aws/continuous/deployment/2018/03/01/inception-pipelines-pt1.html)

## Wrapping Up

Well, that's it for another month. Tune in again next month for Part 4!
