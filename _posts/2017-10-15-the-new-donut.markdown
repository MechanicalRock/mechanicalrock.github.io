Donut was an idea born at [MagenTys](https://magentys.io/) with the intention of making test results more visual and accessible to software development teams. Since its initial commit over a year or so ago it has grown to a rich report which now supports unit, integration and acceptance tests. It also has a number of adaptors and related projects which make it integrate with various test runners and CI tools.

Over the past year, the number of contributors has grown and the product roadmap has become clearer. In that time, [Mechanical Rock](https://www.mechanicalrock.io/) was also born. As both [MagenTys](https://magentys.io/) and [Mechanical Rock](https://www.mechanicalrock.io/) are part of the core contributor team and the donut ecosystem of related projects has grown, it made sense to move it to its own GitHub Organization, similar to how LocalStack has moved from the Atlassian repo to a LocalStack owned one.

The new GitHub Organization is named [Donut Report](https://github.com/DonutReport) and all the projects there (including [Donut](https://github.com/DonutReport/donut)) can be cloned and contributed to in that space.
