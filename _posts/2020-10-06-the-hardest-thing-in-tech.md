## Background

Mechanical Rock is a technical consultancy. At times we can be accused of trying to solve every problem presented to us with a technical solution. Unfortunately, this can be true, but we also spend a lot of time challenging conventional thinking using processes like [Impact Mapping](https://www.impactmapping.org/}) to ascertain the value of potential projects before engaging with customers or before building something. We have been known to turn down many projects or price ourselves out because we believe it is doomed to fail.

The difference between technologists that can look at a bigger picture and those that don't can be a chasm at times. Many engineers tend to want to write code and not to do much else. But the best code, is no code at all!

## The Software Lifecycle

A natural flow in programming is something like this:

1 - _someone_ has a problem
2 - team attempts to understand the problem by talking to _someone_
3 - team works out _if_ the problem can be solved in code
4 - team works out _if_ the problem should be solved in code
5 - team codifies the solution, which includes feedback cycles
6 - team validates problem has been solved with _someone_

> Does this mean that the bulk of the work in programming is non-programming activities?

Engineers who want to progress, often want the salary associated with more responsibility, but are not a good fit for the expectations associated with that increase in salary. This is succinctly articulated by the Peter Principle:

> "People are promoted to their level of incompetence, suggesting that something is fundamentally misaligned in the promotion process"

The dearth of technical talent and the rise of big tech (FAANG), has contributed to the expectation of big salaries in the industry. It is not uncommon for Engineers to be paid above the odds, but are not given a "wider remit" reflective of that. Instead, simply solving problems with code. All the while, the demand for a wholistic view has further increased because of this.

## A Wider Remit

What is a wider remit in software delivery terms?

- help tease out, challenge or solidify the problem. This requires empathy, preparation and communication skills.
- elaborate in a team setting using examples. This requires convergent and divergent thinking and again that old communication chestnut.
- challenge conventional thinking. 
- code
- empathy
- leadership. Coaching. Mentoring.

Programming is hard. People are harder.
