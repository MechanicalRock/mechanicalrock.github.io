# Role of FlutterFlow in Modern App Development: Insights for DevOps Teams

## Introduction

- A click and drag interface for building basic Flutter apps quickly
- Good base for building out a POC or MVP
- Can be used to build out a full app

## What is FlutterFlow?

- A visual editor for building Flutter apps
- Extensive templates and pre-built components
- Database integrations
- Authentication
- Export to code

## Beyond FlutterFlow

- FlutterFlow is a good starting point but you can push the entire code base to github

## DevOps and FlutterFlow

- Automated Testing
  - Flutter Integration tests and firebase test lab
  - Need a pro plan
- Version control
  - Can ClickOps it but better to use git
- CI/CD & Trunk Based Development

  - Can use github actions to build and publish
