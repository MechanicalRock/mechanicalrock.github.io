IT Transformation is not a phrase to be thrown around lightly. The mere mention of it will have people shuddering at the thought of multi million dollar programmes which attempt to shoehorn new organisational structures or technology into an organisation. And in many cases failing to achieve what it set out to do. Fundamentally change the way an organisation runs.

The mistake organisations make is that they view this change in people, process and technology as if it were a road to travel, with a destination. That couldn't be further from the truth. It may be a road to travel, but there is no destination. The destination is actually one of continuous improvement.

Ask yourself this: If I turned of your IT systems tomorrow, could your business still run effectively? I'd wager my house that you can't.

We have a tried and tested path to get companies to where they need to be. It's called the Helix. It is a path to what people may call DevOps Nirvana. It encompasses everything you need in the Development and Operations lifecycle to make any cloud transformation a success. That includes defining collaboratively:

- a process to gain a shared understanding of the software you need to deliver, before you deliver it
- source control management
- branching strategies
- artefact repositories
- build pipelines
- automated testing
- blue green deployment strategies
-

All of the above is completely contextual to teh environment, templated and with a light touch (automated). It also runs by a key tenet that your business is not in running servers (unless you are AWS or Azure), but rather it is delivering value to your customers. If the best option is to use a service, we will tackle the hard questions with the security team and ensure any solution is fit for purpose.

The Helix is underpinned by our Quickstart model.

Why do we use Quickstart? We use it because unless you are proving tangible value along the journey, everything you do is guesswork.
