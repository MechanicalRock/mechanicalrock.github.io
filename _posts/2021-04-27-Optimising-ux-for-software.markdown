My baptism into the cult of Mechanical Rock kicked off with a sword fight (legally, I can't say more) and it got me thinking about the relationship between UX and DevOps. Particularly, how DevOps drives the evolution of UX design.

Sword fight aside, there is opportunity to accelerate technology delivery through the reciprocal relationship between UX and DevOps especially as UX provides a competitive advantage to software delivery.
<br /><br />

## What is UX?

User Experience (UX) “encompasses all aspects of the end user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products” ([Human Centred Design in QLD Toolkit](https://www.forgov.qld.gov.au/human-centred-design-resources)).

UX provides insight into the gaps, challenges and opportunities of a problem space within a specific domain to improve user experience and deliver a specific ROI to key stakeholders and customers. For every one dollar invested in UX yields a hundred dollar return; a return of 9,900% as reported by [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Six+Steps+For+Justifying+Better+UX/-/E-RES117708).

Unfortunately, the inherent value of UX is often not recognised and this may reflect designers ways of working. Traditionally, design operates in a more waterfall environment where siloed work coupled with a lack of understanding about how the system operates impacts user experience and leads to design re-work or developers making decisions without a UX designer ([Talia Lavie](https://techbeacon.com/devops/8-ways-integrate-ux-speed-devops)). Such siloed work between designers and developers is a constraint; slowing down development and delivery. With the evolution of processes and culture, UX practices need to change. A driver of this evolution is DevOps.
<br /><br />

## DevOps

For some, DevOps is a buzzword. They trott it out and throw it around in conversation. For others, DevOps is the How. It’s a practice. A way of working. Or the “foreground to a great cult,” to quote Hamish.

So what is DevOps? When I spoke to Nick about this, he could not help himself but take me back to Toyota and manufacturing. Despite my protests of, “I know this,” Nick persisted and I’m glad he did. What I learnt from our conversation was twofold.

Firstly, DevOps is about removing waste to support the flow of value through a system. It’s also about automation, feedback loops and breaking down silos. DevOps originated from a place of friction, where development and operations had competing challenges impeding delivery. By understanding these dependencies and constraints, silos were removed to create a shared understanding and teams were better equipped to deliver software.

Secondly, I learnt the concept of value in DevOps. Features in software either add value or add waste. Waste being a redundant functionality that is not useful.
<br /><br />

## Design in DevOps

The flow of value through a system is impeded by constraints such as silos. Silos being teams not working together and no shared understanding of the problem space. When UX is siloed from development teams, designers lack shared understanding about software constraints, and therefore the system in which a user experience operates in; decisions are made with partial context; impeding this flow. As Amy Chess considers in her article on [UX and Domain Driven Design](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/03/platform-ux-domain-driven-design-concepts-in-enterprise-ux.php) UX and Domain Driven Design “it’s important to understand these relationships from a UX perspective because they illuminate how interactions between enterprise systems can exert significant impacts on the user experience.” There is value in bringing UX together with DevOps to accelerate technology delivery.

How does UX fit within the DevOps loop? The below diagram (fig 1.0) is based on how designers work with developers at Mechanical Rock.

The first diagram shows the DevOps approach and the second diagram shows where UX fits within that DevOps approach. For example, at Mechanical Rock both designers and developers are involved in the planning stage through an approach called Example Mapping. Here, a shared understanding is fostered. This is where we drill down into what we are building. While developers are testing, designers are creating wireframes of the proposed solution working closely with developers to ensure they understand what they are building and why they are building it. In build, developers are building and designers are conducting usability testing. During this time, the insights and feedback from those usability tests drive the build. We can see design and development is not separate and instead works together.

## Silos and Feedback Loops

In his article on Understanding Feedback Loops in DevOps, [Ant Weiss ](https://medium.com/@antweiss/understanding-feedback-loops-in-devops-e93b92b74bd1) defines feedback loops as “sets of relationships between entities whereas a change in one entity causes a change in another entity and that change eventually leads to a change in the first entity.” He continues by distinguishing feedback loops from notifications emphasising that “the most important feedback loops in our organization aren’t happening within our systems,” suggesting the most important feedback loops are between people and teams.

For example when designers and developers work closely, reciprocal communication reduces miscommunication and latency because of this shared understanding. This is because developers have visibility into usability and the “why.” Designers have visibility into software architecture, how this might impact the build and impact the usability, allowing designers to adjust designs accordingly. Designers and developers are working together. Here designers are a core element to the team rather than an aside and while DevOps is driving the evolution of UX, the competitive advantage for DevOps teams is to ensure their deployments are usable beckoning a reciprocal relationship between UX and DevOps ([Talia Lavie ](https://techbeacon.com/devops/8-ways-integrate-ux-speed-devops)[Kai Brunner](https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/13-ux-principles-it-devops-perspective)). What’s more is that these timely decisions reduce constraints and the impediment of flow through a system. This is important because there is a relationship between length of UX cycle and capital. The longer the cycle, the more capital dwindles ([Kai Brunner](https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/13-ux-principles-it-devops-perspective)). UX with DevOps enables the flow of value.
<br /><br />

## Shared Understanding

A lack of shared understanding about software constraints, and therefore the system in which a user experience operates in, means decisions are made with partial context; impeding this flow and introducing a slow latency. Other than designers and developers working together and feedback loops, another aspect is providing visibility of the current system’s constraints. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is an approach to do that.

VSM is a method used to map value from idea to customer; looking at the processes, pain points, latency and actors involved that may impede or support the flow of value through a system. It is similar to a user journey map except the focus is on software. Read more about VSM from [Patrick Anderson](https://blog.tasktop.com/did-your-organization-wake-up-as-a-software-company-consider-value-stream-management-vsm/).

There is value in designers being part of a VSM workshop. They have greater context around how the current system operates, the constraints, gaps and opportunities and how that is feeding into poor user experience. For example, with a recent client looking at AI/ML, we did not have a complete understanding of how the AI/ML worked, which meant that when we created new screens we made assumptions about the flow. It was not until we re-engaged the client that we had more context. This lack of knowledge was a constraint; it slowed us down. Now VSM is not integral to DevOps, however, VSM provides visibility into the constraints and gaps within a system and this visibility is integral to the value of DevOps. Mapping value from idea to customer provides a designer with more context on the current system and an idea of future state. This context coupled with user research leads to data driven decisions.
<br /><br />

## Why UX and DevOps

DevOps without UX is possible however your return on investment and delivery success is impeded and we see this with website latency costing $2.6 billion ([Design Resources ](https://techjury.net/blog/user-experience-stats/#gref)). I would not recommend it. It is all well and good to accelerate technology delivery but that value is lost if there is no clear strategy and no understanding of users.

Understanding users ensures that the flow of value from DevOps delivers a competitive advantage. Performance issues contribute to 90% of users leaving an app and functionality and design issues cause 86% of users to delete or uninstall an app ([Ewelina Luszczek](https://medium.com/@ewelina.luszczek/what-is-the-business-value-of-ux-design-affc3a1e370b)). This is not a successful deployment. Instead, when UX works together with DevOps, the inherent value of UX is unlocked providing clearer strategy and direction to DevOps. This is the competitive advantage.
<br /><br />

## Wrapping Up

The growth and evolution of UX is spurred on by DevOps ways of working and likewise the success of technology delivery is through the competitive advantage of UX. There is immense value in understanding users, customers and key stakeholders needs and this value is tapped into when it enables flow through a system.
