This post is part of a series covering our development of DevOps Dream:
1. [Having a DevOps Dream][1]
1. Living the DevOps Dream

In my [previous post][1], I covered some of the background to DevOps Dream and where the idea came from.  In this post, I'd like to give some insight into how we _Lived the DevOps Dream_ - how we built the game.

Start with the end in mind - Work backwards from the retrospective.
Metrics
 - number of commits, PRs time-frame.

How did we achieve those metrics

Loop back to the retrospective - what didn't go so well
 - review the incident(s)

 - learnings and what we've changed.


<!-- How we developed DevOps Dream - backed up by metrics -->

<!-- Wins, failures and learnings -->
<!-- Responsive -->
<!-- Post mortems -->

<!-- Key learnings -->

- paper prototypes
- play testing the engine
  - experimentation.  Making the game hard was HARD.
- MVP1 - FIGMA prototypes and user testing the flow
- testing the engine and iteration:
  - statistical tests - testing all permutations impossible.
  - models and results
- the architecture
- dark launch - early feedback
- closed beta testing - shout out and thanks
- prototypes -> build -> user feedback -> polish
- DORA stats:
- 4 key metrics and how we generate them
- Retrospective
  - Batching - 
- the tools we use

Lessons Learned
* UX, BDD and visual design - design system
* Visual Testing
* Product Owner bottlenecks.
