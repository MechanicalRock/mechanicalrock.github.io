![React & Unity](/img/unity-react/cover.jpg)

ReactJS is designed for building dynamic and interactive web experiences with state management. It allows developers to create reusable components or libraries without having to build everything from scratch. This makes it very easy to add additional functionality or animations onto existing applications. 

Unity is a powerful and versatile platform for 3D development. It is known for its ability to handle complex 3D models and environments, as well as its strong focus on creating visually appealing and interactive experiences. Unity also has a strong community and a wealth of documentation and resources available online.

## Web View

Unity is a popular platform for building games and interactive experiences, but it also has many features that make it an ideal choice for other types of applications. One such feature is [Web View](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview), which allows you to display web content within your Unity application.

[Web View](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) can be used to create dynamic user interfaces that can be updated in real-time. For example, if you have a news app built with Unity, you could use [Web View](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) to display the latest headlines from your website or blog. This would allow users to stay up-to-date on the latest news without having to leave the app.

Another benefit of using [Web View](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) is that it allows you to easily integrate web-based functionality into your Unity project. If there's a particular API or service that you need access to in order to build your application, you can simply use [Web View](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) to embed that functionality directly into your project.

[Web View](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) works by creating a new view within your Unity application where web content can be displayed. You can control this view just like any other element in your scene by adjusting its position and size or adding animations and special effects.

## Layered Architecture

The layered architecture pattern is a software design pattern that divides the system into layers. Each layer has a specific responsibility and interacts with the layers above and below it. The layers are typically organized in a hierarchical fashion, with the highest layer being the user interface layer and the lowest layer being the data access layer.

### Layer 1: Unity Application

The Unity application is the bottom layer of the architecture. It contains all of the rendering logic. The Unity application communicates with the other layers through a set of interfaces, which are defined in the Unity application layer.

This layer deploys Web View where it should expand across the entire screen.

### Layer 2: Web View

The Web View layer is responsible for rendering the web content (React application). Since Web View imeplements Chromium engine it can render any web content. This layer initialised the React application, it sits between the Unity application and the React application.

Web View should be implemented to be responsive and stetch the full size of the application viewport. It's z-index should be the topmost so that so React can be rendered on top of the Unity application.


### Layer 3: React Application

The React application is the top layer of the architecture. It contains all of the business logic and data access logic. The React application communicates with the other layers through a set of interfaces, which are defined in the React application layer.
