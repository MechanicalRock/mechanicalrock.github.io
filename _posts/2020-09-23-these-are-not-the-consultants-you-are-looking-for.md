# Warning: this post contains a number of opinionated hot takes formed over the last 20 years of running companies in various countries and contracting or consulting in these countries. If this is not the sort of post you are looking for, then look away now..

## Language is Important

Nothing [gets my goat up](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Get%20Your%20Goat) more than someone confusing or conflating the term *consultant* with that of a *contractor*. Not true, there are a couple of other phrases; the use of "best practice" is amongst them.

The *consultant bible* (here at Mechanical Rock at least), Flawless Consulting by Peter Block, defines a *consultant* as a person in a position to have some influence over an individual, a group, or an organisation but has no direct power to make changes or implement programs. The recipient of this advice is called the *client*.

A *contractor*, as defined by the Cambridge Dictionary, is a person or company that arranges to supply materials or workers for building or for moving goods.

So the difference is pretty clear - *one advises, one does*.

## In Practice

In reality, however, the lines are often blurred between advising and doing. We, for instance, call ourselves *consultants* but often do a mix of engagements which are advising, or advising AND doing. When companies only do the doing and call themselves *consultants*, that is just deception. Even worse, when companies call themselves consultants, but then hire *contractors* to deliver the work, that is worse than deception, it is downright duplicitous.

## A Different Perspective

I lived for many years in the UK and was a professional contractor for a time. IT Contracting is (well, maybe no longer) a way of life for many there. It is a way to earn a great income, with low tax, and also have the flexibility to move around. But it is highly mercenary and is focused around delivering a service, not providing a consulting service. Running a business in the UK, as result, can be a challenge. In a land so permeated by contractors, creating an identity and a culture when the lure of the contractor pound is so prevalent is hard. Contractors, by nature, are not aligned to a "consulting" companies values & goals and also more often than not the processes which influenced the *client* choose them in the first place. This for me is the crux of why I find consulting companies that are in essence giant bodyshops so distasteful.

These companies continue to be successful, so the market must know more than me! Or perhaps the market doesn't know more than me and the people that make these decisions don't care or are motivated in ways which I am not familiar with. Either way, best practice dictates that if you ever see me in the street, please ensure you do not use the words *consultant* and *contractor* interchangeably.
