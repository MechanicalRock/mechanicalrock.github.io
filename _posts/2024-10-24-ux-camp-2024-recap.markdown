> UXCamp is a global network of independent events and Australiaâ€™s only community-driven design unconference. We bring together 200+ local designers and stand for radical collaboration, empathy and curiosity. - [UXCamp Boorloo](https://uxcamp.au/)

This year, the [UXCamp Boorloo](https://uxcamp.au/) was held at the [State Library of Western Australia](https://slwa.wa.gov.au/). The event was a great success, with over 200 attendees from all over Australia. The conference featured a wide range of talks and workshops on topics such as user experience design, interaction design, service design, AI, design systems, psycologic impacts, accessibility, gaming and much more. [There were 41 pitches, 21 talks and a keynote.](https://uxcamp.au/agenda/)

The conference was organised by a team of volunteers, who did an amazing job of putting together a diverse and engaging program. The event was sponsored by a number of local companies, who provided financial support and prizes for the attendees. 

A shout out to the sponsors:

## Buying Ticket Strategy

Unfortunately [Mechanical Rock](https://www.mechanicalrock.io/) missed out on tickets last year. To make sure we didn't miss out this year we put a strategy in place -BRUTE FORCE! We had a team of people ready to buy tickets as soon as they went on sale. Refreshing the page every few seconds, we eventuated with tickets! As any good solution architect should do, they should draw diagrams:
