IT Transformation is not a phrase to be thrown around lightly. The mere mention of it will have some people shuddering at the thought of multi million dollar programmes attempting to shoehorn new organisational structures and / or technology into an organisation. And in many cases failing to achieve what it sets out to do, which was to fundamentally change the way an organisation operates.

The mistake organisations make is that they view this change in people, process and technology as if it were a road to travel, with a destination. That couldn't be further from the truth. It may be a road to travel, but there is no destination. The destination is actually one of continuous improvement and a self sustaining loop. If this isn't adopted form the beginning, then the ultimate goal will likely not be achieved.

Ask yourself this: If I turned of your IT systems tomorrow, could your business still run effectively? I'd wager my house that you can't.

[Mechanical Rock](https://www.mechanicalrock.io/) have a tried and tested path to get companies to where they need to be. It's called the Helix. It is a path to what people may call DevOps nirvana. It encompasses everything you need in the Development and Operations lifecycle to make any cloud based transformation a success. That includes defining collaboratively:

- a process to gain a shared understanding of deliverables
- a process for designing and developing reliable software
- source control management
- branching strategies
- artefact repositories
- build pipelines from Development to Production
- immutable infrastructure
- lift and shift where absolutely necessary
- migration from monolith to serverless where appropriate
- automated testing
- blue green deployment strategies
- monitoring and operations

All of the above is completely contextual to the environment, templated and with a light touch (automated). Although, beware, we are opinionated and will try and influence decisions by using hard data. We also run by a key tenet that **your business is not in the business of running servers** (unless you are AWS or Azure), but rather it is delivering value to your customers. If the best option is to use a service, we will tackle the hard questions with the security team and ensure any solution is fit for purpose. Being in enterprise is not an excuse.

Helix is the wider enterpise view of change which is underpinned by our Quickstart model. The Quickstart program is a combination of training, automation and integrated process that delivers DevOps maturity to any organisation. Quickstart programs are tailored to the client's requirements, driven by the goals identified during the Helix Discovery phase.

Why do we use Quickstart? We use it because unless you are proving tangible value along the journey, everything you do is guesswork.
