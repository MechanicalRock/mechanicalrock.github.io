### Themeability is the path to dark mode
Diana Mounter(GitHub NYC)

Diana walked us through how github has been improving it themeability from using starting with two developerts in 2017 to hiring their first react developer in 2018.
She guided us on their journey from hard coded hex color values to using variables and styles components.

On the path to the ~~dark side~~ dark mode Diana and her team realised that colour is relative and simply inverting the colours would not acheive true dark mode.
